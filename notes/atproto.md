*ATProto aims to become a foundational protocol for decentralized apps. ynot.lol could serve as a gateway to discovering decentralized profiles, helping bridge users across platforms.*


## integration with atproto-based social networks

- features for users to link ynot to atproto accounts for seamless sharing
- profiles on ynot can be posts or embedded previews in atproto apps


## use DIDs to allow users to manage profiles in a decentralized way

- link personal site, profile metadata (bio, interests, tags), and previews through ATProto compatible data repos


## let users authenticate using ATProto

- profiles can sync with ATProto repositories which ensures they own and control their data


## sites listed on ynot can be tied to ATProto's portable data repositories

- if users move their data or hosting, ynot automatically updates their information
- e.g. updating domain info, adding previews are reflected in app without manual updates
- users can seamlessly transition between platforms while maintaining their presence on ynot


## ATProto supports **customizable content algorithms**

- users define how they browse and view sites
- ynot can provide users with the option to filter and sort profiles (tags, regions, topics) using custom atproto algs
- allow devs to create and share their own filtering algorithms


# TODO

look into what functionality atproto could provide regarding community based/decentralized curation of featured profiles and categories
- what mechanisms does atproto have for voting?


look into atproto **event stream** for pushing updates in real time
- could create a live feed of new popular entries using event stream insights


there exists functionality for users to have fine-grained control over access rights to their profile
- public, private, restricted to certain communities or users
- do we want this? how granular? how important is the public and fully social "whitepages" aspect of this app?
